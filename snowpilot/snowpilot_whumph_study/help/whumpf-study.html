<p>The data we are looking for is essentially a snow profile from the surface down to the layer below the
bed surface, or below the failure layer, in the location where you triggered the whumpf.
Dig on the side of the crack where the weak layer collapsed (typically the downslope side of the crack).
Dig your pit as you normally would and conduct an ECT. If possible, we would also love to get layer
densities. </p>
<p>We would like to know the approximate area of the zone that failed (either as an avalanche release or a
simple guess of the area that collapsed in the case of a whumpf without an avalanche) and a short
description of the terrain.<>/p>
<p>If possible it would be great to get a second snowpit from outside the release zone of the whumpf or
avalanche.</p>
