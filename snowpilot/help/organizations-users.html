<p>After registering on SnowPilot, at any time by visiting the <a href ='/snowpilot/user/edit'>Snowpit Preferences</a> page, you may add affiliations with new groups. You may need to do this if you change jobs, or take an avalanche course, where you begin to user SnowPilot, and then need to return to your place of work, which is where new snowpits should be association. Likewise, you may work at northern and southern hemisphere positions, and need to associate snowpits with each of them.
<p>To accomodate avalanche professionals, SnowPilot users may now have up to three group affiliations at any one time. New snowpit profiles can be associated with any of the groups of which a user is a member. After leaving a group, snowpit profiles created by a user, which are associated with that group, remain associated with the group; and the user remins the author, even though the user-group relationship is broken. This much more closely matches how avalanche professionals create snowpit profiles in real life.
<p>This image shows the professional affiliations section of the Snowpit Preferences page:<br />

	<p>
	<b style = "color: #3a88fe;">OUTLINED IN BLUE</b> - you can add a new affiliation with a new group or employer, so that new snowpit profiles may be associated with the new group.
	<p>
	<b style = "color: #ffaa00;" >OUTLINED IN ORANGE</b> - shows the current groups you are affiliated with. When creating a new snowpit profile, you will be able to associate the snowpit with any of these groups. 
	<p>
	<b style = "color: #669c35;">OUTLINED IN GREEN</b> - Only available if you are a member of two or more groups, and have saved your Snowpit Preferences. This will be the Default Organization when creating new snowpit profiles. It can be set to other orgnaizations at the time of creating a new snowpit profile.  This is only available if you are already a member of two or more groups; if you are a member of only one group, you will not have the options ( or need to ) set a default organization.
