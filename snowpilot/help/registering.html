Users may register for <a href = 'http://www.snowpilot.org/user/register' >a new SnowPilot account</a> and need to provide only your name, username, email and password. After registering, you will be directed to enter your Snowpit Preferences. When you create a new snowpit, this will control such things as 
<ul>
	<li>Default State/Province/Country, and possibly even Range or Advisory Region - This will place the google map, and populate the location fields, for new snowpits in the correct location. </li>
	<li>Whether to Measure from Top, or from Bottom</li>
	<li>cm or inches for snowpit depths</li>
	<li>Feet or meters for elevation</li>
	<li>Default hemisphere (N / S and E / W)</li>
	<li>Temperature Units</li>
	<li>Coordinate type (lat/long versus UTM or MGRS)</li>
	<li>Affiliation Type / Organization</li>
</ul>

<p>The last one, Organization Affiliation, can be set to whichever Ski Patrol, Forecast Center, Educational or Reasearch group, or Guide Service. This will allow you to view some 'semi-private' snowpit profiles from other users in that group; and, you will be able to share your snowpit profiles with only members of your group, but not everyone, if you so choose. More about <a href ="&topic:snowpilot/organizations-users&">Organization affiliation and users</a>.

<p>All 'Measurement Unit Prefs' will need to be filled out in order to create a snowpit.
