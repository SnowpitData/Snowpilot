<p>Users may register for <a href = 'http://www.snowpilot.org/user/register' >a new SnowPilot account</a> and need to provide only your name, username, email and password. 
<p>After registering, you will be directed to enter your Snowpit Preferences. When you create a new snowpit, this will control such things as 
<ul>
	<li><b>Default State/Province/Country, and possibly even Range or Advisory Region</b><br />This will place the google map, and populate the location fields, for new snowpits in the correct location. <br />
	    <b>Default location will also affect how you enter DATE AND TIME.</b> <br />
			If you set this to a location <em>outside</em> the US, you should enter date in this format: dd/mm/yyyy , and time is represented in 24 hour format, with no am/pm designation ( e.g. 14:45 versus 2:45pm ).<br />
		  If your default location is <em>inside</em> the US, you should enter data in this format: mm/dd/yyyy , with month before day; and time in 12 hr format, <em>with</em> am/pm. </li>
	<li><b>Default Language</b>: Your default language will determine which language most pages of the website are displayed in. It will also determine the language used when entering a new snowpit profile; and the labels on snowpit profiles that you make.
	<li><b>Measure from Top, Measure from Bottom</b><br />
	    This is an important notation, use your preference. It is a default setting that can be adjusted when a new snowpit is created for each individual pit</li>
	<li>Snowpit Depth Units: cm or inches</li>
	<li><b>Elevation Units: Feet or Meters</b></br>
		<b>Elevation Units affects which background map you are provided</b></br>
		  If you choose <b>feet</b>, the background map will be provided from US Geological Survey mapping data, with contour lines specified in feet.<br />
			If you choose <b>meters</b>, the background map will be provided from OpenTopos/Open Streets data, with contour lines indicated in meters.<br />
			This affects the map used on the 'Create New Snowpit' page, where you can choose the latitude/longitude or UTM coords of a snowpit location.
	  </li>
	<li>Default hemisphere (N / S and E / W)</li>
	<li>Temperature Units</li>
	<li>Coordinate type (Lat/Long, UTM or MGRS)</li>
	<li>Affiliation Type / Organization<br />
	  You can set this beginning with organization type, then the specific organization you'd like to join. Please join an existing organization, do not use <create new item> ( a group ) unless you are certain it does not already exist in the system.<br />
		Multiple group affiliations are possible
	</li>
	<li>Fracture Category</li>
	<li>Hardness Scale</li>
	<li>Language settings<br />
	   Your default language for the SnowPilot website. If you find errors or un-translated text, please let us know at admin@snowpilot.org , with the correct translated words</li>
</ul>

<p>The last one, Organization Affiliation, can be set to whichever Ski Patrol, Forecast Center, Educational or Reasearch group, or Guide Service. This will allow you to view some 'semi-private' snowpit profiles from other users in that group; and, you will be able to share your snowpit profiles with only members of your group, but not everyone, if you so choose. More about <a href ="&topic:snowpilot/organizations-users&">Organization affiliation and users</a>.

<p>All 'Measurement Unit Prefs' will need to be filled out in order to create a snowpit.
