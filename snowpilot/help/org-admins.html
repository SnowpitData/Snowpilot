<p>Organizations may set up an 'Organization Admin', who has special privileges relating to editing snowpits, sharing snowpits with other groups, and managing users within their group. If you would like to be set up as an Org Admin for your group, please contact us at <a href ="mailto:admin@snowpilot.org">admin@snowpilot.org</a>
	
<ul>
	<li>Org Admins may edit the 'unlocked' snowpits created by users in their organization. This includes changing the visibility of the snowpits ( i.e. making them public or private ), and setting them to 'saved and locked.'
	<li>Org Admins have an additional menu item 'Organizations'.  Visiting this link gives them a view of the recent snowpit profiles created by members of their group. 
	<li>On the left side of this page is a list of current, active SnowPilot users associated with the group; the org admin can kick people out of the group ( !! ); or add an existing SnowPilot user to the group.
	<li>Further down in this left column, Org Admins can share their snowpits with other groups. For example, a Ski Patrol may choose to share it's pits ( those marked 'visible by my org ) with the regional Forecast center. By visiting the 'manage your org sharing page', Org Admins can add other groups to view their snowpit profiles.
	<li>Org Admins may serve that role for more than one group. The 'default organization' ( set in snowpit profiles ) will be the one currently managed when theuy visit the Organizations menu link.
</ul>
