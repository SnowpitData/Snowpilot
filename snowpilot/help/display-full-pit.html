<p>You have the option to display the pit as a 'full profile' in which case it will include space for all snow to the ground, even if there is no layer or test result data there.
<p>This option can be found as a checkbox on the Layers tab, below the list of layers on the right 
<p>Leaving this unchecked will dislay only the upper parts of a pit, and eliminate the lower layers that were not dug into in a thick snowpack. <!--a href = '&topic:snowpilot/org-admins&'>Read more.</a-->
