<p>When you have entered all the snowpit profile information you need, you may 'Save Snowpit and Preview.' This will give you a preliminary preview of the Snowpit Profile image. If you need to make any updates, you can still 'Edit Snowpit'; but if everything looks good, you can 'Save, Lock, and Download Snowpit'. Download formats currently include jpg, png, and snowpilot xml.
<p>After being saved and locked, the snowpit can no longer be edited, and is saved to the AvScience database. 
<p>Org Admins have special access to edit snowpits created by users within their group; but only until the snowpit is locked and saved. <a href = '&topic:snowpilot/org-admins&'>Read more.</a>
