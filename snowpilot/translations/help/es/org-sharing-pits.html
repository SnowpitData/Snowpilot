<p>Organizations may share their 'group only' snowpits with other organizations. Here would be an example use case: A ski area may wish to guard some snowpits by setting visibility to 'group only', as a policy [  <a href = '&topic:snowpilot/default-visibility&'>Read more.about setting default visibility</a>]. At the same time, they would like to be able to share these pits with the local forecast center, so that the forecasters understanding of the snowpack may be more complete. An Org Admin of the ski patrol may designate the forecast center group as 'trusted' - members of that group will also be able to view ski area group-only snowpits.
<p>ONly Org Admins may set this up, on the 'Organizations' page. If you need an Org Admin deisgnated for your group, contact us at admin@snowpilot.org. 
<h3>How to set up snowpit sharing with other groups</h3>
<p>On the left side of the Organiztions page for Org Admin users, look at the bottom of the column on the left. There is a link to 'manage your org sharing page.' On this page, you can set up sharing your groups' pits with other groups. 
		<p>You will need to contact an admin at the other group to request that they 'share' their pits with your users. If you need to find out who is the org admin for a particular group, <a href = "mailto:admin@snowpilot.org">email us</a>.
