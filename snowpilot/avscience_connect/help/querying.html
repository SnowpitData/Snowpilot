<h2>There are two pages available for quering snowpits: the <a href ='/snowpilot-query'>Online Snowpits Query Page</a> and the <a href ='/avscience-query'>Full Avscience Database Query</a></h2>

<p>The <a href ='/snowpilot-query'>Online Snowpits Query Page</a> only searches for snowpits submitted via the SnowPilot.org website, and does not include snowpits submitted using the legacy installed desktop Java app. However, the query is completely real-time; a snowpit entered one minute will be available the next.
<p>The <a href ='/avscience-query'>Full Avscience Database Query</a> page searches the combined database of 38,000+ snowpits ( as of July 2021 ), so it is <em>complete</em>. It is ideal if you are a researcher needing large amounts of historical snowpit data; or if you are a long-time user of the installed app version and would like to go back and peruse, and possibly download, your own pits from before Oct. 2016, when the online version went live.
	<p><b>Results Total Count:</b> Both search forms include an option for 'number of results per page', and also a count of total number of results (note-the count currently appears on odd places, such as BELOW the list of snowpits, so look around). The count may be the most useful thing on there.
	<p><b>Filter Options</b> These allow the user to filter the list of snowpits according to several variables: Min and Max Dates, Region or State, username, and Group affiliation. Because of how the data is stored differently, the options can vary quite a bit between the tow query pages. For example, the Full Avscience page has a 'multi-select box' to choose the regions you want to include in the query. It needs to be multi-select, because there are some duplicate names; to get all the snowpits from the Bridger Range, you would need to select all the variations of 'bridgers', 'bridger range', 'Bridger Mountains', etc. incluing a few misspellings! This is becuase this field is an open text field on the installed SnowPilot app-whatever the user types in is saved. This is in contrast to the online version, where regions are a fixed dropdown list. There are about 1000 unique region names in the avscience database, contrasted with 280 or so in the online form. Both systems work well; you, as user, need to be ready to 'multi-select' lots of different region names in order to get the complete list of data.
  <p><b>Export Options</b> Each page offers various export buttons or links ( again, different locations on the different pages, look around ). The Avscience Query pages offers exports of Snowpilot XML ( output to browser ), CAAML ( tarred and gzipped folder of snowpit .caaml files ), or CSV ( gzipped ) . The Snowpilot query page includes only a SnowPilot XML format, at this time ( TODO ).
