<p>The Avscience Connect module performs a variety of functions that are useful for snow science researchers. Here are a few things:
<ul>
	<li>Manages the import of snowpits entered using the installed application, and snowpits from the online version of SnowPilot, into the central Avscience database.</li>
	<li>Displays and processes the queries from two different query pages: <a href ='/snowpilot-query'>Online Snowpits Query Page</a> and the <a href ='/avscience-query'>Full Avscience Database Query</a></li>
	<li>Delivers xml feeds from the above query pages as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>These pages are primarily designed for snow science researchers and online data providers. The final product of these pages is the xml feeds of data. These are limited to 100 records at a time (at most); but if you find that you need vastly more data, or need to query it on the basis not provided here, <a href = "mailto:admin@snowpilot.org">please contact us</a>.
