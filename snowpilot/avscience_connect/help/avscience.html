<p>The Avscience Connect module performs a variety of functions that are useful for snow science researchers. Here are a few things:
<ul>
	<li>Displays and processes the queries from two different query pages: <a href ='/snowpilot-query'>Online Snowpits Query Page</a>, which queries the drupal database for public snowpits; this page is accessible by anonymous and registered users; and the <a href ='/avscience-query'>Full Avscience Database Query</a>, which queries the complete avscience database, for all pits, but with user data removed for anonymity.</li>
	<li>Delivers xml feeds from the above query pages as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>These pages are primarily designed for snow science researchers and online data providers. The final product of these pages is the xml feeds of data. These are limited to 500 records at a time (at most); but if you find that you need vastly more data, or need to query it on the basis not provided here, <a href = "mailto:admin@snowpilot.org">please contact us</a>.
