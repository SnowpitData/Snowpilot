<h2>Displaying data for snow science researchers</h2>
<p>Displays and processes the queries from two different query pages:
<ul>
	<li> <a href ='/snowpilot-query'>Online Snowpits Query Page</a>, which queries the drupal database for public snowpits; this page is accessible by registered and anonymous users</li>
	<li> <a href ='/avscience-query'>Full Avscience Database Query</a>, which queries the complete avscience database, for all pits. This query is accessible only by Avalanche Researchers or Administrators.</li>
	<li>Delivers data in CAAML, SnowPilot XML, and CSV formats from the above query pages as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>These pages are primarily designed for snow science researchers and online data providers (e.g. a 'Recent Snowpits' map for your area ). The final product of these pages are the various data output formats, filtered for just those of interest. These are limited to 500 records at a time (at most); but if you find that you need vastly more data, or need to query it on the basis not provided here, <a href = "mailto:admin@snowpilot.org">please contact us</a>.
